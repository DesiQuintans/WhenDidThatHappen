Description: The goal of 'WhenDidThatHappen' is to take raw Date or Datetime
    data (either as one-row-per-subject or many-rows-per-subject) and produce 
    outcome and time-to-event outputs that are ready for survival analysis using 
    common packages such as 'survival', 'coxme', and 'cmprsk'. 'WhenDidThatHappen'
    supports simple and composite outcomes, with optional blanking periods and 
    optional minimum observation periods.
