Description: 'WhenDidThatHappen' prepares survival analyses. It takes your raw 
    Datetimes (either as one- or many-rows-per-subject) and derives time-to-event 
    variables for use with common packages such as 'survival', 'coxme', and 
    'cmprsk'. It supports right-censored simple and composite outcomes, with 
    optional blanking periods and minimum observation periods.
